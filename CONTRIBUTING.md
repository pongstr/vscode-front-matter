- [Sample Projects](https://github.com/FrontMatter/project-samples)

## How to get started

- Start by forking this project;
- Clone your fork to your local machine;
- Run `pnpm i`;
- Open the project in VS Code;
- To start developing, run `pnpm dev:ext` and press `f5` to start the debugging session.

### Tips

- Ensure that the main branch on your fork is in sync with the original **vscode-front-matter** repository

```bash
# assuming you are in the folder of your locally cloned fork....
git checkout main

# assuming you have a remote named `upstream` pointing to the official **vscode-front-matter** repo
git fetch upstream

# update your local main to be a mirror of what's in the main repo
git pull --rebase upstream main
```

- Create a feature branch in your fork. In case you get stuck, or have issues with merging your PR, this will allow you to have a clean main branch that you can use for contributing other changes.

```bash
git checkout -b issue/<id>
```
